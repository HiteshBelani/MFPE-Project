Cognizant MFPE project - Product Feedback Management System

This Project was created for Cognizant MFPE project evaluations.

The usage of the internet to buy various items for daily necessities has grown significantly in recent years. Customers now prefer making purchases of numerous things online. However, the numerous e-commerce sites and growing number of online retailers make it challenging for shoppers to choose a certain product. 
A customer frequently wants to discover what other customers who have already purchased the same product think about it. Therefore, using implicit user feedback, we tried to rate products. In this project, we randomly selected a small number of goods and their respective Companies and Categories and tried to take their feedback from the Customers and rate them accordingly so that the other customers can see the rating and feedback of the products and make correct choices while buying.
